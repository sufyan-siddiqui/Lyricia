# Lyricia

A shitty Discord Bot that will tell you the lyrics of a song.

## Commands

**!getlyrics <args>** - pass the args in format ArtistName-SongName (separate artist and songname with a hyphen)

### To Invite:
[Click Here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=724143167380783105&permissions=2048&scope=bot)

**Its online 24/7**

### Things to consider
- Its slow as 2020 Ferrari F1 when you search for a song for the first time, but gets it instantly the next time.

## TODO:

- [ ] Heroku is a bitch, destroys my local files whenever I push new code so I'll probably have to use some other storage method

- [ ] Fix the API (make the search faster)
